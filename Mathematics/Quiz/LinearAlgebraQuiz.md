# Linear Algebra Quiz (20 Questions)

**1. Which of the following best describes the primary advantage of using the L1 norm in machine learning, particularly in regularization techniques like Lasso?**
- [ ] A) It provides a smoother loss landscape, leading to faster convergence during training.
- [ ] B) It ensures that all feature weights are positive, preventing negative correlations.
- [ ] C) It encourages sparsity in the model by driving some feature weights to exactly zero.
- [ ] D) It is computationally less expensive to calculate compared to the L2 norm.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) The L1 norm's absolute value function introduces non-differentiability at zero, which can make the loss landscape less smooth.
- B) The L1 norm does not restrict weights to be positive.
- C) The L1 norm's property of promoting sparsity is a key reason for its use in feature selection, as it effectively eliminates the influence of less important features.

**2. A data scientist is working with a dataset where each data point represents a customer's purchasing behavior, encoded as a vector. If they want to find customers with very similar purchasing patterns, which linear algebra concept would be most directly applicable for measuring this similarity, assuming the magnitude of purchases is also important?**
- [ ] A) Outer Product
- [ ] B) L-infinity Norm
- [ ] C) Matrix Inversion
- [ ] D) Inner Product

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
- A) Outer product creates a matrix of interactions, not a single similarity measure between two vectors.
- B) L-infinity norm focuses on the maximum difference, not overall similarity.
- C) Matrix inversion is for "undoing" matrix operations, not for measuring similarity between vectors.
- D) The inner product (dot product) measures the projection of one vector onto another, and its magnitude reflects both the similarity in direction and the magnitudes of the vectors. A larger inner product indicates greater similarity in both pattern and scale.

**3. Consider a scenario in Natural Language Processing where words are represented as vectors. If two word vectors have an inner product close to zero, what does this most likely imply about the words they represent?**
- [ ] A) The words are synonyms.
- [ ] B) The words are orthogonal, suggesting they are semantically unrelated or independent in the context of the vector space.
- [ ] C) The words have very high frequency in the corpus.
- [ ] D) The words are antonyms.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) Synonyms would have vectors pointing in very similar directions, resulting in a large positive inner product.
- B) An inner product of zero indicates orthogonality, meaning the vectors are perpendicular. In semantic spaces, this often implies a lack of direct relationship or independence.
- C) Word frequency is not directly indicated by the inner product.
- D) Antonyms might have vectors pointing in somewhat opposite directions, but "unrelated" is a more general implication of orthogonality.

**4. In the context of image processing, a grayscale image can be represented as a matrix. If you apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to this image matrix, what do the largest singular values primarily represent?**
- [ ] A) The most significant features and overall structure of the image.
- [ ] B) The fine details and textures of the image.
- [ ] C) The noise components in the image.
- [ ] D) The color channels of the image.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- A) The largest singular values capture the most variance and thus represent the most dominant and significant features or the overall structure of the image. This is why SVD is effective for image compression.
- B) Fine details are typically associated with smaller singular values.
- C) Smaller singular values often correspond to noise.
- D) Grayscale images do not have color channels.

**5. A machine learning model is trained to predict house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, and age.

- [ ] A) L-infinity Norm
- [ ] B) L1 Norm
- [ ] C) Frobenius Norm
- [ ] D) L2 Norm

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

- B) L1 norm sums absolute errors, giving equal weight to all errors.
- C) Frobenius norm is for matrices, not typically for error vectors in this context.
- D) L2 norm squares errors, penalizing larger errors more, but it's still an aggregate measure.

**6. Why is the concept of "linear independence" crucial when considering the features in a machine learning dataset?**
- [ ] A) It ensures that the dataset can be perfectly visualized in a 2D or 3D space.
- [ ] B) It indicates that each feature provides unique, non-redundant information, which is important for model interpretability and avoiding multicollinearity.
- [ ] C) Linearly independent features always lead to higher model accuracy.
- [ ] D) It guarantees that the dataset is perfectly balanced across all classes.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) Visualization depends on the number of features, not just linear independence.
- B) Linearly independent features mean that no feature can be expressed as a linear combination of others, ensuring each contributes unique information. This helps in building robust models and avoiding issues like multicollinearity.
- C) While often beneficial, linear independence doesn't guarantee higher accuracy.
- D) Linear independence is unrelated to class balance.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- A) Linear regression fundamentally involves projecting the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace (the line or hyperplane) to find the closest approximation, thereby minimizing the orthogonal distance (errors).
- B) Eigenvalues are related to transformations and principal components, but not directly the core concept of finding the best fit line in linear regression.
- C) Outer product creates a matrix of interactions.
- D) Matrix inversion is used in the formula for linear regression, but the underlying geometric principle is projection.

**15. A machine learning model uses the L2 norm to penalize large errors. If a model makes an error of 4, and another model makes two errors of 2, how does the L2 norm penalize these scenarios differently, and why?**
- [ ] A) The L2 norm penalizes both scenarios equally because it only considers the total sum of errors.
- [ ] B) The L2 norm is not suitable for comparing errors of different magnitudes.
- [ ] C) The L2 norm penalizes the two errors of 2 more heavily because it sums the absolute values.
- [ ] D) The L2 norm penalizes the single error of 4 more heavily because errors are squared, making $4^2$ much larger than $2^2+2^2$.

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
- A) This is incorrect; the squaring operation makes it sensitive to larger errors.
- B) The L2 norm is widely used for comparing errors and is particularly sensitive to large errors.
- C) This describes the L1 norm.
- D) The L2 norm squares errors. For an error of 4, the penalty is $4^2 = 16$. For two errors of 2, the penalty is $2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$. Thus, the single large error is penalized more heavily.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) An identity matrix has a determinant of 1 and is invertible.
- B) Singularity is related to the determinant and linear dependence, not directly to the matrix's dimensions (though it must be square to have an inverse).
- C) A singular matrix has a determinant of zero, which means its columns (or rows) are linearly dependent, and therefore it is not invertible (does not have a unique inverse).
- D) Diagonal matrices are not necessarily singular.

**20. A machine learning model is designed to predict a continuous output. During training, the model's performance is evaluated using a metric that heavily penalizes large prediction errors. Which norm is most likely being used as the basis for this error metric?**
- [ ] A) L1 Norm
- [ ] B) L-infinity Norm
- [ ] C) Frobenius Norm
- [ ] D) L2 Norm

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
- A) L1 norm (Mean Absolute Error) penalizes errors linearly.
- B) L-infinity norm focuses on the single largest error, not necessarily a heavy penalty for all large errors in aggregate.
- C) Frobenius norm is for matrices, not typically for error vectors in this context.
- D) The L2 norm (Mean Squared Error) squares the errors, which means larger errors are penalized disproportionately more heavily than smaller errors. This is a common characteristic of error metrics designed to strongly penalize outliers or significant deviations.
