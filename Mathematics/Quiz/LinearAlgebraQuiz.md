# Linear Algebra Quiz (20 Questions)

**1. Which of the following best describes the primary advantage of using the L1 norm in machine learning, particularly in regularization techniques like Lasso?**
- [ ] A) It ensures that all feature weights are positive, preventing negative correlations.
- [ ] B) It encourages sparsity in the model by driving some feature weights to exactly zero.
- [ ] C) It provides a smoother loss landscape, leading to faster convergence during training.
- [ ] D) It is computationally less expensive to calculate compared to the L2 norm.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) The L1 norm does not restrict weights to be positive.
- B) The L1 norm's property of promoting sparsity is a key reason for its use in feature selection, as it effectively eliminates the influence of less important features.
- C) The L1 norm's absolute value function introduces non-differentiability at zero, which can make the loss landscape less smooth.
- D) While computation might differ, the primary advantage is not computational cost but its effect on model sparsity.

**2. A data scientist is working with a dataset where each data point represents a customer's purchasing behavior, encoded as a vector. If they want to find customers with very similar purchasing patterns, which linear algebra concept would be most directly applicable for measuring this similarity, assuming the magnitude of purchases is also important?**
- [ ] A) L-infinity Norm
- [ ] B) Outer Product
- [ ] C) Inner Product
- [ ] D) Matrix Inversion

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) L-infinity norm focuses on the maximum difference, not overall similarity.
- B) Outer product creates a matrix of interactions, not a single similarity measure between two vectors.
- C) The inner product (dot product) measures the projection of one vector onto another, and its magnitude reflects both the similarity in direction and the magnitudes of the vectors. A larger inner product indicates greater similarity in both pattern and scale.
- D) Matrix inversion is for "undoing" matrix operations, not for measuring similarity between vectors.

**3. Consider a scenario in Natural Language Processing where words are represented as vectors. If two word vectors have an inner product close to zero, what does this most likely imply about the words they represent?**
- [ ] A) The words are synonyms.
- [ ] B) The words are antonyms.
- [ ] C) The words are orthogonal, suggesting they are semantically unrelated or independent in the context of the vector space.
- [ ] D) The words have very high frequency in the corpus.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) Synonyms would have vectors pointing in very similar directions, resulting in a large positive inner product.
- B) Antonyms might have vectors pointing in somewhat opposite directions, but "unrelated" is a more general implication of orthogonality.
- C) An inner product of zero indicates orthogonality, meaning the vectors are perpendicular. In semantic spaces, this often implies a lack of direct relationship or independence.
- D) Word frequency is not directly indicated by the inner product.

**4. In the context of image processing, a grayscale image can be represented as a matrix. If you apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to this image matrix, what do the largest singular values primarily represent?**
- [ ] A) The noise components in the image.
- [ ] B) The fine details and textures of the image.

- [ ] D) The color channels of the image.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) Smaller singular values often correspond to noise.
- B) Fine details are typically associated with smaller singular values.
- C) The largest singular values capture the most variance and thus represent the most dominant and significant features or the overall structure of the image. This is why SVD is effective for image compression.
- D) Grayscale images do not have color channels.

**5. A machine learning model is trained to predict house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, and age.

- [ ] A) L1 Norm
- [ ] B) L2 Norm
- [ ] C) L-infinity Norm
- [ ] D) Frobenius Norm

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) L1 norm sums absolute errors, giving equal weight to all errors.
- B) L2 norm squares errors, penalizing larger errors more, but it's still an aggregate measure.
- C) The L-infinity norm (max norm) specifically identifies the single largest absolute value in a vector, making it ideal for detecting and being sensitive to the worst-case error.
- D) Frobenius norm is for matrices, not typically for error vectors in this context.

**6. Why is the concept of "linear independence" crucial when considering the features in a machine learning dataset?**
- [ ] A) Linearly independent features always lead to higher model accuracy.
- [ ] B) It ensures that the dataset can be perfectly visualized in a 2D or 3D space.
- [ ] C) It indicates that each feature provides unique, non-redundant information, which is important for model interpretability and avoiding multicollinearity.
- [ ] D) It guarantees that the dataset is perfectly balanced across all classes.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) While often beneficial, linear independence doesn't guarantee higher accuracy.
- B) Visualization depends on the number of features, not just linear independence.
- C) Linearly independent features mean that no feature can be expressed as a linear combination of others, ensuring each contributes unique information. This helps in building robust models and avoiding issues like multicollinearity.
- D) Linear independence is unrelated to class balance.

**7. In the context of matrix inversion, if a square matrix has a determinant of zero, what can be concluded?**

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) Outer product creates a matrix of interactions.
- B) Matrix inversion is used in the formula for linear regression, but the underlying geometric principle is projection.
- C) Linear regression fundamentally involves projecting the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace (the line or hyperplane) to find the closest approximation, thereby minimizing the orthogonal distance (errors).
- D) Eigenvalues are related to transformations and principal components, but not directly the core concept of finding the best fit line in linear regression.

**15. A machine learning model uses the L2 norm to penalize large errors. If a model makes an error of 4, and another model makes two errors of 2, how does the L2 norm penalize these scenarios differently, and why?**
- [ ] A) The L2 norm penalizes the two errors of 2 more heavily because it sums the absolute values.
- [ ] B) The L2 norm penalizes the single error of 4 more heavily because errors are squared, making $4^2$ much larger than $2^2+2^2$.
- [ ] C) The L2 norm penalizes both scenarios equally because it only considers the total sum of errors.
- [ ] D) The L2 norm is not suitable for comparing errors of different magnitudes.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) This describes the L1 norm.
- B) The L2 norm squares errors. For an error of 4, the penalty is $4^2 = 16$. For two errors of 2, the penalty is $2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$. Thus, the single large error is penalized more heavily.
- C) This is incorrect; the squaring operation makes it sensitive to larger errors.
- D) The L2 norm is widely used for comparing errors and is particularly sensitive to large errors.

- [ ] C) A matrix is singular if it is an identity matrix; it has a unique inverse.
- [ ] D) A matrix is singular if it has more rows than columns; it has a unique inverse.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) Diagonal matrices are not necessarily singular.
- B) A singular matrix has a determinant of zero, which means its columns (or rows) are linearly dependent, and therefore it is not invertible (does not have a unique inverse).
- C) An identity matrix has a determinant of 1 and is invertible.
- D) Singularity is related to the determinant and linear dependence, not directly to the matrix's dimensions (though it must be square to have an inverse).

- [ ] C) L-infinity Norm
- [ ] D) Frobenius Norm

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) L1 norm (Mean Absolute Error) penalizes errors linearly.
- B) The L2 norm (Mean Squared Error) squares the errors, which means larger errors are penalized disproportionately more heavily than smaller errors. This is a common characteristic of error metrics designed to strongly penalize outliers or significant deviations.
- C) L-infinity norm focuses on the single largest error, not necessarily a heavy penalty for all large errors in aggregate.
- D) Frobenius norm is for matrices, not typically for error vectors in this context.
