**1. A square matrix A is both symmetric and orthogonal. What can be definitively concluded about its eigenvalues?**
- [ ] A) All eigenvalues must be 0.
- [ ] B) All eigenvalues must be either 1 or -1.
- [ ] C) All eigenvalues must be complex numbers.
- [ ] D) All eigenvalues must be greater than 1.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) If all eigenvalues were 0, the matrix would be a zero matrix, which is not necessarily orthogonal.
- B) For a symmetric matrix, all eigenvalues are real. For an orthogonal matrix, all eigenvalues must have an absolute value of 1. The only real numbers that satisfy this condition are 1 and -1.
- C) A symmetric matrix cannot have complex eigenvalues.
- D) This violates the property of orthogonal matrices.

**2. In a constrained optimization problem, if a Lagrange multiplier (λ) associated with an equality constraint is found to be zero, what does this imply about the constraint?**
- [ ] A) The constraint is redundant and does not affect the optimal solution.
- [ ] B) The problem is infeasible.
- [ ] C) The constraint is active at the optimal solution.
- [ ] D) The objective function is independent of the variables in that constraint.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- A) A zero Lagrange multiplier indicates that a small relaxation of the constraint would not change the value of the objective function. This means the constraint is not binding or is redundant at the optimum.
- B) A zero multiplier does not imply infeasibility.
- C) An active constraint typically has a non-zero multiplier.
- D) This is not necessarily true.

**3. The Hessian matrix of a function f(x) is found to be positive semi-definite at a point x* where the gradient is zero. What can be concluded about x*?**
- [ ] A) x* is a global maximum.
- [ ] B) x* is a saddle point.
- [ ] C) x* is a local minimum, but not necessarily a strict minimum.
- [ ] D) x* is a strict local minimum.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A) A positive semi-definite Hessian indicates convexity, not concavity.
- B) A saddle point would have an indefinite Hessian.
- C) A positive semi-definite Hessian at a critical point guarantees a local minimum. However, because it is not strictly positive definite, the minimum might not be strict (i.e., there could be a flat region).
- D) A positive definite Hessian is required for a strict local minimum.

**4. The Adam optimization algorithm uses bias-corrected estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients. Why is this bias correction necessary?**
- [ ] A) To ensure the learning rate is always positive.
- [ ] B) To counteract the fact that the moment estimates are initialized at zero and are therefore biased towards zero, especially during the initial steps of training.
- [ ] C) To prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima.
- ] D) To handle non-convex objective functions.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) The moving averages for the moments are initialized as vectors of zeros. Without bias correction, these estimates would be skewed towards zero at the beginning of training, which can lead to a smaller than desired learning rate. The correction term compensates for this initial bias.

**5. If the rank of a matrix A is less than the number of its columns, what can be said about the solutions to the linear system Ax = 0?**
- [ ] A) The system has no solution.
- [ ] B) The system has a unique, non-trivial solution.
- [ ] C) The system has infinitely many non-trivial solutions.
- [ ] D) The system has only the trivial solution (x = 0).

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- C) If the rank is less than the number of columns, it means the columns are linearly dependent. This implies that the null space of the matrix has a dimension greater than zero, and therefore the equation Ax = 0 has infinitely many non-trivial solutions.

**6. The L1 norm is often used in machine learning for feature selection because:**
- [ ] A) It is a differentiable function, making it easy to optimize.
- [ ] B) Its geometric shape (a diamond in 2D) has sharp corners, which encourages solutions where some parameters are exactly zero.
- [ ] C) It is more sensitive to outliers than the L2 norm.
- [ ] D) It is invariant to rotations of the feature space.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) The non-differentiability of the L1 norm at the axes (the corners of its level sets) makes it more likely for the optimization process to find a solution where some weights are precisely zero, effectively performing feature selection.

**7. In the context of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix A = UΣV^T, what do the columns of the matrix U represent?**
- [ ] A) The eigenvectors of A^T A.
- [ ] B) The eigenvectors of A A^T.
- [ ] C) The singular values of A.

**8. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean of a large number of i.i.d. random variables will be approximately normal. What is the variance of this sampling distribution?**
- [ ] A) σ^2 / n, where σ^2 is the population variance and n is the sample size.
- [ ] B) σ^2, the population variance.
- [ ] C) σ / n, where σ is the population standard deviation.
- ] D) n * σ^2.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- A) The variance of the sample mean is the population variance divided by the sample size. This shows that as the sample size increases, the sample mean becomes a more precise estimate of the population mean.

**9. The Jacobian matrix of a function f: R^n -> R^m represents the best linear approximation of the function at a point. If the Jacobian is a zero matrix at a certain point, what does this imply?**
- [ ] A) The function is at a global minimum.
- [ ] B) The function is constant in the neighborhood of that point.
- [ ] C) The function is undefined at that point.
- ] D) The function is at a critical point (a potential minimum, maximum, or saddle point).

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
- D) A zero Jacobian means that all the first-order partial derivatives are zero, which is the definition of a critical or stationary point.

**10. What is the key difference between Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation?**
- [ ] A) MLE can only be used for discrete distributions, while MAP is for continuous distributions.
- [ ] B) MAP incorporates a prior distribution over the parameters, while MLE does not.
- [ ] C) MLE is always a biased estimator, while MAP is always unbiased.
- ] D) MAP is computationally simpler than MLE.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) MAP estimation combines the likelihood of the data with a prior belief about the parameters, effectively regularizing the estimate. MLE only considers the likelihood.

**11. If a matrix is both symmetric and idempotent (A^2 = A), what can be said about its eigenvalues?**
- [ ] A) They must all be 1.
- [ ] B) They must all be 0.
- [ ] C) They must be either 0 or 1.
- ] D) They must be real and positive.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- If λ is an eigenvalue of A, then λ^2 is an eigenvalue of A^2. Since A^2 = A, we have λ^2 = λ, which means λ(λ-1) = 0. Therefore, the only possible eigenvalues are 0 and 1.

**12. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are necessary for a solution to be optimal in a constrained optimization problem. The "complementary slackness" condition states that for an inequality constraint g(x) <= 0, at the optimal solution x*, either:**
- [ ] A) The constraint is active (g(x*) = 0) or its corresponding Lagrange multiplier is zero.
- [ ] B) The constraint is inactive (g(x*) < 0) and its corresponding Lagrange multiplier is positive.
- [ ] C) The constraint is active and its corresponding Lagrange multiplier is zero.
- ] D) The constraint is always active.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- A) This condition implies that if a constraint is not binding (i.e., the solution is not on the boundary of that constraint), then its corresponding multiplier must be zero, meaning it does not affect the solution.

**13. The L-infinity norm of a vector is defined as the maximum absolute value of its components. What is its geometric interpretation in 2D space?**
- [ ] A) A circle.
- [ ] B) A diamond.

**14. If two random variables X and Y are independent, what is the covariance between them?**
- [ ] A) 1
- [ ] B) -1
- [ ] C) 0
- ] D) It depends on their variances.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- C) If two random variables are independent, their covariance is zero. However, the converse is not always true (zero covariance does not imply independence).

**15. The outer product of two non-zero vectors u and v results in a matrix A. What is the rank of this matrix A?**
- [ ] A) 0
- [ ] B) 1
- [ ] C) 2
- ] D) It depends on the dimensions of u and v.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) The outer product of two non-zero vectors always results in a rank-1 matrix, as all columns of the resulting matrix are scalar multiples of the vector u, and all rows are scalar multiples of the vector v^T.

**20. The RMSprop optimization algorithm uses an exponentially moving average of the squared gradients. What is the primary purpose of this?**
- [ ] A) To prevent the learning rate from becoming too large.
- [ ] B) To introduce momentum into the updates.
- [ ] C) To prevent the learning rate from decaying to zero too quickly, which is a problem in AdaGrad.
- ] D) To approximate the second derivative of the loss function.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- C) AdaGrad's learning rate can become infinitesimally small because it accumulates all past squared gradients. RMSprop uses a moving average, which gives more weight to recent gradients and effectively "forgets" the distant past, preventing the denominator in the learning rate update from growing too large.

**21. What is the geometric interpretation of the determinant of a 2x2 matrix?**
- [ ] A) The length of the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the column vectors.
- [ ] B) The area of the parallelogram formed by the column vectors.

- [ ] A) 0
- [ ] B) 1 or -1
- [ ] C) Always 1
- ] D) It can be any real number.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) Since Q^T Q = I, we have det(Q^T Q) = det(I) = 1. This means det(Q^T)det(Q) = 1, and since det(Q^T) = det(Q), we have (det(Q))^2 = 1. Therefore, det(Q) must be either 1 (for a rotation) or -1 (for a reflection).

- [ ] A) It contains the origin.
- [ ] B) For any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is also entirely contained within the set.
- [ ] C) It is a circle or a sphere.
- ] D) It can be described by a set of linear inequalities.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

- [ ] A) Positive.
- [ ] B) Negative.
- [ ] C) Zero.
- ] D) Equal to 1.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- C) This is due to the complementary slackness condition. If a constraint is inactive (i.e., not binding), its corresponding multiplier must be zero.

**30. The Frobenius norm of a matrix is:**
- [ ] A) The maximum absolute column sum.
- [ ] B) The square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements.
- [ ] C) The largest singular value.

- [ ] A) It is a discrete distribution.
- [ ] B) It is memoryless.
- [ ] C) Its mean and variance are equal.
- ] D) It is symmetric.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) The memoryless property means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of how much time has already elapsed. For example, if the average waiting time for a bus is 10 minutes, and you have already waited 5 minutes, the expected future waiting time is still 10 minutes.

**33. The LU decomposition of a matrix A factors it into A = LU, where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. This decomposition is primarily used for:**
- [ ] A) Finding the eigenvalues of A.
- [ ] B) Efficiently solving systems of linear equations Ax = b.
- [ ] C) Dimensionality reduction.
- ] D) Calculating the rank of A.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- B) Once A is decomposed, solving Ax = b becomes a two-step process of solving Ly = b (forward substitution) and then Ux = y (backward substitution), which is computationally much faster than inverting A.

- [ ] A) 28/52
- [ ] B) 30/52
- [ ] C) 26/52
- ] D) 32/52

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- P(Red or King) = P(Red) + P(King) - P(Red and King)
- P(Red) = 26/52
- P(King) = 4/52
