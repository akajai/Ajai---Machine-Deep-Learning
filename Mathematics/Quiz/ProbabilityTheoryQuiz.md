**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

- B) The L1 norm (Lasso) adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero. The L2 norm (Ridge) adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, which results in small but non-zero coefficients.
- C) Both L1 and L2 regularization can be used with various types of models.
- D) The L2 norm is more sensitive to outliers because it squares the error terms.

**30. In the context of a rare disease test, why can a positive test result still mean a low probability of having the disease?**
- [ ] A) Because the test has a high false negative rate.
- [ ] B) Because of the high number of false positives compared to the number of true positives.
- [ ] C) Because the prior probability of having the disease is high.
- [ ] D) Because the test is not accurate.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A) A high false negative rate would mean that many people with the disease would test negative, but it doesn't explain why a positive test result would still mean a low probability of having the disease.
- B) When a disease is rare, the number of people without the disease is much larger than the number of people with the disease. Even with a low false positive rate, the absolute number of false positives can be larger than the number of true positives. This is an application of Bayes' theorem.
- C) If the prior probability is high, a positive test result would lead to a high posterior probability.
- D) The test can be very accurate (high true positive rate and low false positive rate) and this can still be the case.
