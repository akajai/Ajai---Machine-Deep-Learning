    "\n",
    "The core idea is to calculate the probability of an email being spam given its features, and compare that to the probability of it being not spam. According to Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{Class} | \\text{Features}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Features} | \\text{Class}) \\cdot P(\\text{Class})}{P(\\text{Features})} $$\n",

    "Since we only care about which class has a higher probability, we can ignore the denominator $P(\\text{Features})$ and compare the posteriors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{posterior} \\propto \\text{likelihood} \\times \\text{prior} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid numerical underflow (multiplying many small probabilities results in a number too small for the computer to store), we work with the log of the probabilities:\n",
