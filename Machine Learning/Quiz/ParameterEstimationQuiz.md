Here are 20 multiple-choice questions based on the Parameter Estimation notes.

### Questions

1.  **What is parameter estimation?**
    *   [ ] A) The process of calculating the exact characteristics of a sample.
    *   [ ] B) The process of using sample data to make an educated guess about a population characteristic.
    *   [ ] C) The process of collecting data from an entire population.
    *   [ ] D) The process of selecting a sample from a population.

    **Answer: B) The process of using sample data to make an educated guess about a population characteristic.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. While we calculate statistics from a sample, the goal is to infer something about the population, not just describe the sample.
    *   B is correct. Parameter estimation is about using a smaller, manageable sample to estimate the properties (parameters) of a larger population.
    *   C is incorrect. This is a census, which is often impractical. Parameter estimation is used when a census is not possible.
    *   D is incorrect. This is sampling, which is a step in the process of parameter estimation, but not the estimation itself.

2.  **In the analogy of tasting a pot of soup, what does the entire pot of soup represent?**
    *   [ ] A) The sample
    *   [ ] B) The parameter
    *   [ ] C) The population
    *   [ ] D) The statistic

    **Answer: C) The population**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. The spoonful of soup is the sample.
    *   B is incorrect. The true overall saltiness of the soup is the parameter.
    *   C is correct. The entire pot of soup represents the whole group we are interested in, which is the population.
    *   D is incorrect. The saltiness of the spoonful is the statistic.

3.  **What is the difference between a parameter and a statistic?**
    *   [ ] A) A parameter describes a sample, while a statistic describes a population.
    *   [ ] B) A parameter is a guess, while a statistic is a known value.
    *   [ ] C) A parameter describes a population, while a statistic describes a sample.
    *   [ ] D) There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable.

    **Answer: C) A parameter describes a population, while a statistic describes a sample.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. This reverses the definitions.
    *   B is incorrect. A parameter is the true, often unknown, value for a population. A statistic is calculated from a sample and is known.
    *   C is correct. A parameter is a characteristic of a population (e.g., the true average height of all students). A statistic is a characteristic of a sample (e.g., the average height of 100 students).
    *   D is incorrect. They are distinct concepts.

4.  **Which of the following is an example of a point estimate?**
    *   [ ] A) "We are 95% confident the average height is between 5'7" and 5'9"."
    *   [ ] B) "The average height of the students in our sample is 5'8"."
    *   [ ] C) "The sample includes 100 students."
    *   [ ] D) "The heights in the sample range from 5'2" to 6'1"."

    **Answer: B) "The average height of the students in our sample is 5'8"."**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. This is an interval estimate, as it provides a range.
    *   B is correct. A point estimate is a single value used to estimate the population parameter. The sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean.
    *   C is incorrect. This is the sample size.
    *   D is incorrect. This is the range of the sample data, not a single estimate of the average.

5.  **What is the main advantage of an interval estimate over a point estimate?**
    *   [ ] A) It is always more accurate.
    *   [ ] B) It is easier to calculate.
    *   [ ] C) It acknowledges and quantifies the uncertainty of an estimate.
    *   [ ] D) It provides a single, definitive answer.

    **Answer: C) It acknowledges and quantifies the uncertainty of an estimate.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. It's not necessarily more accurate, but it is more informative. The true parameter might even fall outside the interval.
    *   B is incorrect. Interval estimates are more complex to calculate than point estimates.
    *   C is correct. An interval estimate (like a confidence interval) provides a range of plausible values and a confidence level, which directly addresses the uncertainty that comes from using a sample instead of the whole population.
    *   D is incorrect. A point estimate provides a single answer; an interval estimate provides a range.

6.  **In "the Gaussian case," what are the two parameters that completely describe the distribution?**
    *   [ ] A) The mean and the median.
    *   [ ] B) The mean and the variance.
    *   [ ] C) The variance and the standard deviation.
    *   [ ] D) The sample mean and the sample variance.

    **Answer: B) The mean and the variance.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. For a Gaussian distribution, the mean and median are the same, but the median doesn't describe the spread.
    *   B is correct. A Gaussian (Normal) distribution is fully defined by its mean (μ), which sets its center, and its variance (σ²), which sets its spread.
    *   C is incorrect. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so they represent the same information about spread, but you still need the mean.
    *   D is incorrect. The sample mean and sample variance are *estimates* of the true population parameters, not the parameters themselves.

7.  **In most real-world statistical problems, the true population mean (μ) is...**
    *   [ ] A) Known
    *   [ ] B) Unknown
    *   [ ] C) Always equal to zero
    *   [ ] D) The same as the sample mean

    **Answer: B) Unknown**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. If μ were known, there would be no need to estimate it.
    *   B is correct. The entire purpose of parameter estimation is to make an educated guess about μ because it's impractical or impossible to measure the entire population.
    *   C is incorrect. The mean can be any value.
    *   D is incorrect. The sample mean (x̄) is an *estimate* of the population mean (μ). It is extremely unlikely that they are exactly the same.

8.  **What is the best point estimate for an unknown population mean (μ)?**
    *   [ ] A) The sample size (n)
    *   [ ] B) The sample median
    *   [ ] C) The sample mean (x̄)
    *   [ ] D) The sample standard deviation (s)

    **Answer: C) The sample mean (x̄)**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. The sample size is used in calculations but does not estimate the average.
    *   B is incorrect. While the median can be a measure of center, the sample mean is the standard and most efficient point estimate for the population mean, especially in the Gaussian case.
    *   C is correct. The sample mean is the most common and intuitive point estimate for the population mean.
    *   D is incorrect. The standard deviation estimates the spread, not the center.

9.  **In multivariate statistics, what does the mean vector (μ) represent?**
    *   [ ] A) The average of all variables combined.
    *   [ ] B) A vector containing the average value for each individual variable.
    *   [ ] C) The relationship between the different variables.
    *   [ ] D) The spread of the data for each variable.

    **Answer: B) A vector containing the average value for each individual variable.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. It doesn't make sense to average different units (like height and weight).
    *   B is correct. The mean vector is a collection of the mean values of each of the multiple variables being studied. For example, {average height, average weight}.
    *   C is incorrect. The relationship between variables is described by the covariance matrix.
    *   D is incorrect. The spread is described by the variances within the covariance matrix.

10. **What information is contained in the covariance matrix (Σ)?**
    *   [ ] A) Only the average of each variable.
    *   [ ] B) Only the spread (variance) of each variable.
    *   [ ] C) The variance of each variable and the covariance between each pair of variables.
    *   [ ] D) The point estimates for the mean of each variable.

    **Answer: C) The variance of each variable and the covariance between each pair of variables.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. This is the mean vector.
    *   B is incorrect. It contains more than just the variances.
    *   C is correct. The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are the variances of each variable, and the off-diagonal elements are the covariances, which describe how the variables move together.
    *   D is incorrect. These are point estimates for the mean vector, not the covariance matrix.

11. **What does a positive covariance between height and weight indicate?**
    *   [ ] A) As height increases, weight tends to decrease.
    *   [ ] B) As height increases, weight tends to increase.
    *   [ ] C) There is no relationship between height and weight.
    *   [ ] D) The variance of height is the same as the variance of weight.

    **Answer: B) As height increases, weight tends to increase.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. This would be a negative covariance.
    *   B is correct. Positive covariance means that when one variable is above its mean, the other variable tends to be above its mean as well, indicating they move in the same direction.
    *   C is incorrect. This would be a covariance of or near zero.
    *   D is incorrect. Covariance describes the relationship between variables, not the equality of their variances.

12. **What is the best point estimate for the population covariance matrix (Σ)?**
    *   [ ] A) The sample mean vector (x̄)
    *   [ ] B) The population mean vector (μ)
    *   [ ] C) The sample covariance matrix (S)
    *   [ ] D) A vector of the sample standard deviations.

    **Answer: C) The sample covariance matrix (S)**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A and B are incorrect. These are estimates for the population mean vector.
    *   C is correct. The sample covariance matrix (S) is the direct estimate for the unknown population covariance matrix (Σ).
    *   D is incorrect. This would only give information about the spread of each variable, not the relationships between them.

13. **In statistics, what does "bias" refer to?**
    *   [ ] A) The tendency of an estimator to consistently over or underestimate a true parameter.
    *   [ ] B) The error made in a single estimation.
    *   [ ] C) The level of confidence in an interval estimate.
    *   [ ] D) The personal opinion of the researcher.

    **Answer: A) The tendency of an estimator to consistently over or underestimate a true parameter.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is correct. Bias is a systematic error. An unbiased estimator is correct on average over many samples, while a biased estimator is systematically wrong.
    *   B is incorrect. A single error is just that, an error. Bias refers to the long-run average performance of the estimator.
    *   C is incorrect. This is the confidence level.
    *   D is incorrect. Statistical bias is a mathematical property, not a personal one.

14. **An estimator is called "unbiased" if...**
    *   [ ] A) It always gives the correct answer.
    *   [ ] B) It has the smallest possible variance.
    *   [ ] C) Its guesses, on average, hit the true parameter value.
    *   [ ] D) It is derived from a Maximum Likelihood Estimation.

    **Answer: C) Its guesses, on average, hit the true parameter value.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. No estimator is perfect for every sample; this is too strong a condition.
    *   B is incorrect. This refers to efficiency, not bias.
    *   C is correct. The expected value of an unbiased estimator is equal to the true population parameter. This means its errors cancel out over repeated sampling.
    *   D is incorrect. MLE estimators can sometimes be biased.

15. **What is the relationship between Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and bias?**
    *   [ ] A) MLE estimators are always unbiased.
    *   [ ] B) MLE estimators are always biased.
    *   [ ] C) MLE is a method that can sometimes produce biased estimators.
    *   [ ] D) MLE is a method for correcting bias in other estimators.

    **Answer: C) MLE is a method that can sometimes produce biased estimators.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A and B are incorrect. There is no absolute guarantee either way.
    *   C is correct. While MLE is a very powerful and common estimation technique, it does not guarantee that the resulting estimator will be unbiased. For example, the MLE for the variance of a Gaussian distribution has a denominator of 'n', which is biased, whereas the unbiased sample variance uses 'n-1'.
    *   D is incorrect. MLE is for estimation, not directly for bias correction.

16. **Why is the sample variance often calculated with a denominator of (n-1) instead of n?**
    *   [ ] A) To make the calculation simpler.
    *   [ ] B) To make the estimate unbiased.
    *   [ ] C) To make the variance larger.
    *   [ ] D) It is a historical convention with no mathematical reason.

    **Answer: B) To make the estimate unbiased.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. Using 'n' would be simpler.
    *   B is correct. Using 'n' as the denominator produces a biased estimator of the population variance (it tends to be too small). Dividing by (n-1), known as Bessel's correction, corrects for this bias, making the sample variance an unbiased estimator of the population variance.
    *   C is incorrect. While it does make the variance slightly larger than using 'n', this is a consequence of the correction, not the goal.
    *   D is incorrect. There is a strong mathematical reason for this practice.

17. **A 95% confidence interval means that...**
    *   [ ] A) There is a 95% probability that the sample mean is in the interval.
    *   [ ] B) 95% of the sample data falls within this interval.
    *   [ ] C) If we were to take many samples and create intervals, 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.
    *   [ ] D) There is a 95% probability that the true population parameter is in this specific interval.

    **Answer: C) If we were to take many samples and create intervals, 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. The sample mean is always in the center of the interval by construction.
    *   B is incorrect. This is not the definition of a confidence interval.
    *   C is correct. This is the frequentist interpretation of a confidence interval. It's a statement about the long-run performance of the method used to create the interval.
    *   D is subtly incorrect. Once an interval is calculated, the true parameter is either in it or not. The 95% refers to the reliability of the process, not the probability of a single outcome.

18. **In the multivariate case, the diagonal elements of the sample covariance matrix (S) are the...**
    *   [ ] A) Sample covariances
    *   [ ] B) Sample means
    *   [ ] C) Sample variances
    *   [ ] D) Sample standard deviations

    **Answer: C) Sample variances**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. Covariances are the off-diagonal elements.
    *   B is incorrect. Means are in the mean vector.
    *   C is correct. The diagonal elements of a covariance matrix represent the variance of each individual variable.
    *   D is incorrect. They are the variances, not the standard deviations (which are the square roots of the variances).

19. **If you want to estimate the average income of all households in a city, what is the population?**
    *   [ ] A) The average income you calculate from your sample.
    *   [ ] B) The 500 households you survey.
    *   [ ] C) All households in the city.
    *   [ ] D) The city itself.

    **Answer: C) All households in the city.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is the statistic.
    *   B is the sample.
    *   C is correct. The population is the entire group about which you want to make an inference.
    *   D is the geographic location, not the group being studied.

20. **A large variance (σ²) in a Gaussian distribution means that...**
    *   [ ] A) The data is tightly clustered around the mean.
    *   [ ] B) The data is widely spread out from the mean.
    *   [ ] C) The mean of the data is large.
    *   [ ] D) The distribution is not bell-shaped.

    **Answer: B) The data is widely spread out from the mean.**

    **Explanation:**
    *   A is incorrect. This describes a small variance.
    *   B is correct. Variance is a measure of spread or dispersion. A larger variance means the data points are, on average, farther from the mean.
    *   C is incorrect. The mean and variance are independent parameters; a large variance can exist with any mean.
    *   D is incorrect. The distribution is still bell-shaped; it's just a wider, flatter bell.
