# Bagging and Boosting Quiz

**1. What is the fundamental principle behind ensemble learning?**
- [ ] A) A single, highly complex model is always better than multiple simple models.
- [ ] B) The collective decision of a group of diverse models is often better than a single model.
- [ ] C) Ensemble learning is only effective for regression problems.
- [ ] D) The goal of ensemble learning is to increase model bias.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- Ensemble learning is based on the "wisdom of crowds" principle, where combining the predictions of several models leads to a more robust and accurate final prediction.
- **A)** Ensemble learning argues against the reliance on a single model.
- **C)** It is effective for both classification and regression problems.
- **D)** The goal is to reduce bias and/or variance, not increase them.

**2. What is the primary difference between Bagging and Boosting?**
- [ ] A) Bagging is a sequential method, while Boosting is a parallel method.
- [ ] B) Bagging aims to reduce bias, while Boosting aims to reduce variance.
- [ ] C) Bagging trains models independently, while Boosting trains models sequentially, with each learning from the previous one's mistakes.
- [ ] D) Bagging can only be used with decision trees, while Boosting can be used with any model.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- This is the core distinction. Bagging (a parallel method) trains models simultaneously and independently. Boosting (a sequential method) trains models one after another, with each new model focusing on the errors of its predecessor.
- **A)** This is the opposite of the correct answer.
- **B)** Bagging primarily reduces variance, while Boosting primarily reduces bias.
- **D)** Both methods can be used with various types of models, although decision trees are common.

**3. What is "bootstrapping" in the context of Bagging?**
- [ ] A) Training a model on the entire dataset.
- [ ] B) Creating multiple datasets by sampling with replacement from the original dataset.
- [ ] C) Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- [ ] D) Selecting only the most important features for training.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- Bootstrapping is the process of generating multiple new datasets of the same size as the original by drawing samples with replacement. This introduces diversity among the training sets for the individual models.
- **A, C, D)** These are other common machine learning practices but do not describe bootstrapping.

**4. What is the main goal of the Random Forest algorithm?**
- [ ] A) To create a single, deep decision tree.
- [ ] B) To reduce the bias of a single decision tree.
- [ ] C) To reduce the variance of a single decision tree by combining many decorrelated trees.
- [ ] D) To use a different type of model for each tree in the ensemble.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- Random Forest is a bagging technique that builds a large number of decision trees and merges their predictions. By averaging the results, it reduces the variance and overfitting tendencies of individual decision trees.
- **A)** It creates many shallow trees, not a single deep one.
- **B)** Its primary goal is to reduce variance, not bias.
- **D)** Random Forest is a homogeneous ensemble, meaning all base models are decision trees.

**5. How does Random Forest introduce additional diversity among its trees, beyond what standard Bagging does?**
- [ ] A) By using a different type of model for each tree.
- [ ] B) By training each tree on a completely different dataset.
- [ ] C) By randomly selecting a subset of features to consider at each split point.
- [ ] D) By using a different learning rate for each tree.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- This is the key innovation of Random Forest. By restricting the features available at each split, it prevents the individual trees from all relying on the same strong predictors, thus making them more diverse and less correlated.
- **A, B, D)** These are incorrect descriptions of how Random Forest works.

**6. In AdaBoost, how does the algorithm force new models to focus on the mistakes of previous models?**
- [ ] A) By removing the correctly classified data points from the training set.
- [ ] B) By increasing the weights of the misclassified data points.
- [ ] C) By using a different algorithm for each new model.
- [ ] D) By training new models on the residual errors.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- AdaBoost adaptively re-weights the training samples at each iteration. The weights of the data points that were misclassified by the previous weak learner are increased, so the next learner is forced to pay more attention to them.
- **A, C)** These are incorrect.
- **D)** This is the mechanism used by Gradient Boosting, not AdaBoost.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- A stump is a very simple decision tree that makes a prediction based on a single feature. It is a classic example of a "weak learner" that is often used as the base model in AdaBoost.
- **A, C, D)** These are incorrect.

**8. How does Gradient Boosting work to correct the errors of previous models?**
- [ ] A) It trains each new model to predict the residual errors of the previous model.
- [ ] B) It gives a higher weight to the models that perform better.
- [ ] C) It uses a voting mechanism to combine the predictions.
- [ ] D) It randomly selects a subset of data points to train on.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
- Gradient Boosting is a sequential method where each new model is trained to predict the errors (residuals) of the ensemble's current prediction. By adding this new prediction, the overall model's error is reduced.
- **B, C)** These are characteristics of other ensemble methods.
- **D)** This is a characteristic of Bagging.

**9. What is the role of the "learning rate" in Gradient Boosting?**
- [ ] A) It determines the depth of the decision trees.

**Explanation:**
- The learning rate is a hyperparameter that shrinks the contribution of each weak learner. A smaller learning rate requires more trees in the ensemble but can lead to better generalization.
- **A, C, D)** These are incorrect.

**10. What is the key idea behind Stacking (Stacked Generalization)?**
- [ ] A) To combine the predictions of base models using a simple voting or averaging scheme.
- [ ] B) To use a machine learning model to learn the best way to combine the predictions of base models.
- [ ] C) To train a single, very deep neural network.
- [ ] D) To use only one type of base model.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

- [ ] A) A random value.
- [ ] B) The average value of the target variable.
- [ ] C) The prediction of the first weak learner.
- [ ] D) Zero.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- Gradient Boosting starts with a simple initial guess, which for regression problems is typically the mean of the target variable. Subsequent models are then trained to correct the errors from this initial guess.

- [ ] C) Data leakage can occur if the training data is not split properly.
- [ ] D) It is computationally very fast.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- A common pitfall in Stacking is data leakage, where the base models are trained and evaluated on the same data that is then used to train the meta-model. This can lead to an overly optimistic performance estimate.

- [ ] A) Boosting
- [ ] B) Stacking
- [ ] C) Bagging
- [ ] D) A single SVM.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

- [ ] C) Its weight remains the same.
- [ ] D) The data point is removed from the dataset.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
- The weights of correctly classified data points are decreased, so that the next weak learner can focus on the more difficult, previously misclassified points.
- **A, C, D)** These are incorrect.

**26. What is the main trade-off in the Bias-Variance decomposition?**
- [ ] A) A model with high bias will also have high variance.
- [ ] B) A model with low bias will also have low variance.
- [ ] C) Increasing a model's complexity typically decreases its bias but increases its variance.
- [ ] D) The bias-variance trade-off only applies to linear models.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- This is the fundamental trade-off. As you make a model more complex (e.g., a deeper decision tree), it can fit the training data better (lower bias), but it becomes more sensitive to the specific training data, leading to higher variance and potential overfitting.
- **A, B)** These are not necessarily true.
- **D)** The trade-off applies to all supervised learning models.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
- The initial models trained on the training data are called base models or Level 0 models. Their predictions are then used to train the Level 1 meta-model.
- **A, B, D)** These refer to the model that combines the predictions of the base models.

**29. What is the primary advantage of using a heterogeneous ensemble in Stacking?**
- [ ] A) It is simpler to implement than a homogeneous ensemble.
- [ ] B) It leverages the diverse strengths of different algorithms.
