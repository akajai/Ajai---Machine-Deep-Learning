## Linear Regression Model: 50 MCQ Questions

Here are 50 multiple-choice questions based on the Linear Regression Model, complete with answers and detailed explanations.

---

**Question 1:** What is the primary goal of linear regression?

- [ ] A) To classify data into different categories.
- [ ] B) To find the simplest possible relationship between inputs and outputs to predict a continuous value.
- [ ] C) To group similar data points together.
- [ ] D) To reduce the number of features in a dataset.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

*   **A is incorrect:** Classification is used for predicting qualitative (categorical) outputs, not continuous values.
*   **B is correct:** Linear regression aims to model the relationship between independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output) to make predictions.
*   **C is incorrect:** Clustering algorithms, like K-means, are used to group similar data points.
*   **D is incorrect:** Dimensionality reduction techniques, like PCA, are used to reduce the number of features.

**Question 2:** In linear regression, what are the input variables also known as?

- [ ] A) Response Variables
- [ ] B) Dependent Variables
- [ ] C) Independent Variables
- [ ] D) Output Variables

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

*   **A, B, and D are incorrect:** These terms refer to the output variable, which is what we are trying to predict.
*   **C is correct:** The input variables are the features that are used to predict the output, and they are called independent variables.

**Explanation:**

*   **A, C, and D are incorrect:** These are all classification tasks, as the output is a qualitative category (spam/not spam, flower species, churn/no churn).
*   **B is correct:** Predicting the price of a house is a regression task because the output (price) is a quantitative, continuous value.

---

---

**Question 7:** How does one-hot encoding represent categorical variables?

- [ ] A) By assigning a unique integer to each category.
- [ ] B) By creating a new binary column for each category.

- [ ] D) By ignoring the categorical variables.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

*   **A is incorrect:** This is the definition of label encoding.

**Question 20:** If the slope of a regression line is 0, what does this imply?

- [ ] A) There is no relationship between the input and output variables.
- [ ] B) The output is always 0.
- [ ] C) The input is always 0.
- [ ] D) The model is perfect.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

*   **A is correct:** A slope of 0 means that changes in the input variable do not affect the output variable.

**Question 27:** In multiple linear regression, how many independent variables are there?

- [ ] A) Only one.
- [ ] B) Two or more.
- [ ] C) None.
- [ ] D) It depends on the dependent variable.

- [ ] A) Using more data.
- [ ] B) Using a simpler model.
- [ ] C) Using regularization techniques.
- [ ] D) All of the above.

---

**Question 46:** If a linear regression model has a high bias, what does this suggest?

- [ ] A) The model is overfitting the data.
- [ ] B) The model is underfitting the data.
- [ ] C) The model is a good fit.

---

**Question 47:** If a linear regression model has a high variance, what does this suggest?

- [ ] A) The model is overfitting the data.
- [ ] B) The model is underfitting the data.
- [ ] C) The model is a good fit.
- [ ] D) The model has a low R-squared value.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

**Question 48:** What is the trade-off between bias and variance?

- [ ] A) As bias increases, variance decreases, and vice versa.
- [ ] B) As bias increases, variance also increases.
- [ ] C) As bias decreases, variance also decreases.
- [ ] D) There is no trade-off between bias and variance.

**Answer:** A

**Question 49:** Which of the following is a regularization technique used in linear regression?

- [ ] A) Ridge regression.
- [ ] B) Lasso regression.
- [ ] C) Both A and B.

---

**Question 50:** What is the main difference between Ridge and Lasso regression?

- [ ] A) Ridge regression can shrink coefficients to exactly zero, while Lasso cannot.
- [ ] B) Lasso regression can shrink coefficients to exactly zero, while Ridge cannot.
- [ ] C) Ridge regression is used for classification, while Lasso is used for regression.
- [ ] D) There is no difference.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

*   **B is correct:** The L1 penalty in Lasso regression has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero, which can be useful for feature selection. The L2 penalty in Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not set them to exactly zero.
