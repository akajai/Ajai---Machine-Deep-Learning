# Introduction to AI, ML, DL, & Data Analytics

This document provides a foundational understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), outlining their historical development, core concepts, and interrelationships. It also delves into key aspects of data analysis, including data types, quality, characteristics, and preprocessing techniques, along with methods for calculating dissimilarities

## Machine Learning (ML)

ML addresses the question of whether a computer can "learn on its own how to perform a specified task" by automatically learning data-processing rules from data, rather than being explicitly programmed.

### Essential Components to implement ML

1. Input data points.
2. Examples of the expected output.
3. A method to measure the algorithm's performance.

<u>Examples of ML</u>: Machines playing chess, detecting and deleting spam, language translation.

## ML vs. Classical Statistics Comparison:

| Feature         | Statistical Approach                  | Machine Learning                        | 
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | 
| Approach        | Modeling data generating process      | Algorithmic modeling                    | 
| Driver          | Math, Theory                         | Fitting data using optimization technique| 
| Focus           | Hypothesis testing                   | Predictive accuracy                     | 
| Data Size       | Any reasonable set                   | Large-scale dataset                     | 
| Dimensions      | Mostly for low-dimensional data      | High-dimensional data                   |
